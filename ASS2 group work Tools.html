    <p>For this assignment, our team has set up and designed a workflow which ensures that all team members are able to contribute to the assignment.</p>
    <p>We have opted to use Microsoft Teams as the main gateway for communication and file sharing. With a Working Document that contains up-to-date information on group progress, as well as separating sections of the assignment with different files, team members can efficiently view and edit the contents of the assignment with other members in real-time.</p>
    <p>Teams also provide group members with a platform to set up and schedule meetings through a third-party extension named Polly, which allows group members to vote with a poll system, making scheduling much simpler and easier.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">

    <p>With the meetings, Teams has been utilized to gather members remotely to discuss the assignment through voice calling, as well as the ability to record meetings for future reference. These meetings have been stored into the Microsoft Teams file repository, as shown below.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="Team Recordings.png">
    <p>We have also created a GitHub repository, posturing for future assignments in which technological artifacts are to be produced, and hence the ability to quickly push and pull coding segments, documents, or other specific files quickly without disrupting the workflow of the group is highly valued. Our group has also used GitHub to create a website for the assignment report, with a modern and appealing design and user interface, allowing for website visitors to easily traverse the different sections of the report.  </p>
    <p>As of the time of assignment submission, the GitHub trail has not been utilized as efficiently as possible due to the nature of working in Microsoft Teams. </p>
