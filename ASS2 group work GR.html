    <h4>Brian</h4>
    <p>After an initial hurdle in gathering and communicating with group members, the following weeks went smoothly. Due to the usage of scheduling software and MS Teams communication, group members were able to provide their availabilities for a group meeting each week. The allocation of group work also went well, with each member contributing fairly and efficiently, and allowed for members to focus their efforts to produce higher quality content within a given timeframe. Project meeting minutes were met each week, with each meeting having clear agendas and discussions on the project’s tasks. However, improvements could be made, such as difficulties in scheduling due to uncontrollable circumstances. What surprised me was the discussion and contribution of each member during the meetings online, and especially during face-to-face meetings. I learned that each member could contribute to a project in their own way to maximize quality and different perspectives.</p>

    <p>The meeting went very well, each week, we would join the meeting and discuss our agenda, what we have done since the last meeting, what is to be done in the week that meeting is on. Work allocation also went very well as we each get assigned to do a part of the project (as well as group work).  There are several things that went well but can be improved, such as the choosing the right time to have a meeting as everyone have different schedule, for me personally I could not make one of the meetings, but my groups perfectly summarize and explained to me what was happening. One thing that was surprising is how well members of my group did their part and contributed to the whole project, as we always finish our part before the meeting and be ready for it. One thing I have learned is that working together with others is a necessary skill, especially in an IT project, as I can see how well we collaborate and work on certain tasks of the project.</p>

    <p>We had a little bit of a slow start to the group work, but I was overall impressed with how it all came together in the end. I was hesitant about the collaborative process, but MS Teams made it easy to share files and communicate - I was particularly pleased with the automatic transcription service and meeting recording function. We did run into trouble when a member of our group went missing, but the rest of us pulled together and allocated tasks in a way that felt fair. I enjoyed working on a smaller part of the assignment and seeing it come together with everyone else's components. It was not too hard to schedule meetings, and I found it easy enough to keep track of all the different components. I think the more group work we do, the more efficient we will become at divvying up the tasks and getting all our parts together. Because group work is a central part of the IT industry, I endeavor to improve this skill in the future.  </p>

    <p>Our group cooperation encountered some difficulties at the beginning. Because at the beginning, we often encountered the situation that members did not attend the meeting due to unclear meeting time. Thanks to the video function, although I missed the meeting several times at the beginning, I still knew what I should do and caught up with the progress. In the middle and later stage, our group cooperation is very smooth. Everyone can complete their tasks well and providing help for others. In the process of this cooperation, I better realized the importance of teamwork.</p>

      <p>On reflection of the way our group has performed during the process of completing assignment I have assessed that we as group despite any hurdles or trouble we may have faced during the process of completing this assignment are a group that is able to adjust to quickly adjust and work out selves in the right direction and make progress. Despite a rocky start our group albeit late was able to eventually able to communicate properly through the use of teams and organize meetings in which I think our groups was really able to make progress and create a good platform for discussion in regards to the parts of the assignment we had all been working on, these meetings we’re always quite productive as we we’re all able to determine what was left to do, timelines for tasks, set dated goals for completion of tasks. One thing I learned about working in a group is that you always have somebody for some help in whatever doing as personally I’m used to working on assignments myself this time if I ever had a problem, I was able to discuss with classmates that to my surprise where always more than willing to help and assist in any way possible.  I believe next time we need to work on setting up schedules earlier so that we accommodate all team members and not to leave it in the last minute and run the risk of members not being able to turn up.</p>

      <p>I’m proud of Gamers. The teamwork overall went great. We communicated effectively over MS Teams, worked on documents, shared files, and conducted group meetings. In class we had useful progressive discussions that ensured the path was paved. At the start we cruised along somewhat, but we struck when the time was right. Despite none of us having ever used MS Teams before, I was surprised at its efficacy with collaborative word processing. I’ve learned that frequent communication to check in and make sure everyone's on the same page contributes greatly to the achievement of a group project. </p>
