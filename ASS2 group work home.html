        <h3>Anh</h3>
        <p><i>My name is Quoc Anh Trinh(s3944736). I’m currently a student at RMIT studying for a bachelor of IT. I was born in Vietnam and moved to Australia mid 2015. I love collecting figures and displaying them in my room. My interest in IT comes from watching sci-fi movies and fixing/modding electronics as well as building my first computer. I’m part of Team Gamers in Intro to IT Semester 1(2022). </i></p>
        <h4>Anh’s Test Outcomes</h4>
        <p>MBTI: INTP<br>Learning Style: Reflector<br>Leadership Test: Metamodern <br>The tests indicated that I am introverted and prioritize efficiency over everything else. I believe my behavior in a team is determined by myself, and it would be cooperating with others to achieve the best possible outcome. In a team, I expect everyone to contribute equally and do something that they are best at, which will increase the efficiency of the project. Taking these into account when forming a team, I’d like to find others who are different from me in terms of learning style and personality, so see their point of view on projects and their solution development and combine it with mine to effectively find/create the best results. </p>
