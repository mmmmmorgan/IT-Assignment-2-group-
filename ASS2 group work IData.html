    <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?  </h3>
    <h4>Brian (Senior Systems Administrator)</h4>
    <p>After looking at the Burning Glass 2018 data, my opinion of my ideal job as a Senior Systems Administrator has not changed. According to Labour Insight Jobs 2018, a Systems Administrator is among the titles of Java Developers and Network Engineers, with a clear demand in the IT industry. This is also without ‘Senior’ in the title, in which Senior Sysadmins would be even more scarce and in demand, which ultimately helps me continue to strive for this goal.</p>
    <p>Within the same study, the Skills in Greatest Demand also feature skills many of which Systems Administrators use daily. Such features involve Communication Skills and Teamwork/Collaboration, highly touted skills that, although they not founded in IT theory and education, is highly regarded in a workplace environment with team infrastructure, ensuring messages and tasks are clear and concise. Problem Solving and Troubleshooting are skills that are generally important for Sysadmins to possess, should any issues arise during the workday, ensuring performance is not hindered.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="11.png">
    <p>The table entry above is from the Skills Priority List by the National Skills Commission as of June 2021. The entry Strong indicates the Future Demand Indicator, which further depicts that my assessment in my ideal job was correct, the demand for Systems Administrators, barring the Senior, is strong regardless. As my ideal job is a Senior Sysadmin, I firmly believe in its future potential as a career goal.</p>
    <p>The overall view of my ideal job stays consistent in my expectations, in both the demand for Sysadmins in the IT industry, as well as what specific skills/requirements must be met in order to attain the title.</p>
    <h4>Mingrui (Web Developer)</h4>
    <p>After looking at the Burning Glass 2018 data, my opinion of my ideal job as a Web developer has not changed. From Labour Insight Jobs, I can get that the proportion of web developer's top title in all types of work is at a medium level, and its demand in the IT industry is stable. At the same time, according to the demand for general skills and IT skills, I find that I have a high adaptability to the skills required by my ideal career. This is the same as my expectation.</p>
    <h4>Quoc Anh Trinh(Software Developer)</h4>
    <p>After looking at the Burning Glass 2018 data, my opinion of my ideal job as a Software Developer has not changed, although I have reconsidered some points. According to the National Skill Commission (NSC), it represents the title as not in a shortage in the current labor market assessment, but will be a strong future demand, which means that there will be more opportunities for me to get into this field after finishing University.  According to the Labour market insight Australian website, employment in this field of study has increased by 2.5% over the last quarter, or 4.4% over the last year. It is projected to grow by 206,600 over the next 4 years (2026).</p>
    <p>The burning glass data also shows that most people in this industry (or specifically Software Developer) have formal qualifications, with around 59% have Uni qualifications and 20% with VET qualifications. Many people with this job works full time (92%, which is much higher than the average 66%). However, the salary is often generous in exchange for long working hours. This has sparked some thoughts into me, as I expected to be working long hours, but the data surprised me with how much people are working as a software developer</p>
    <p>However, my overall view of my ideal job stay mostly the same, in both the demands for Software Developer in Australia and the skills required. Although I might have to reconsider some points with the working hours.</p>
    <h4>Darcy (Technical Support)</h4>
    <p>My ideal job working as a Support Technician has not changed after reflection on the Burning Glass 2018 data. ‘Labour Market Insights’ sees very strong growth in the role over the next five years, predicting a 17.4% increase. Additionally, stable full-time work employment is high at 83% which makes the job a great option. However, the opportunities in this field are more abundant in NSW than Vic, at 34.7% vs. 26.8% Australia-wide, in which the possible prospect of moving inter-state poses a new consideration. Just under 20% of workers in the field possess a Year 12 education and the same goes for an Advanced Diploma, making it feasible for me since I’m undertaking Information Technology as a subject elective and not the Bachelors.</p>
    <h4>Kabir (Network Architect)</h4>
    <p>After analyzing and reviewing the Burning Glass Data 2018, my opinion of my ideal job has not totally shifted but has shown me what other jobs in the networking field  are available and are in demand, for example the job of title of a Network Engineer is position that has much higher demand as compared to my ideal of job of a Network Architect which has 546 less jobs postings according to Burning Glass data 2018. Due to this I did have to reconsider whether or not I would still want this to be my ideal job but after having looked at Skills Priority List from the National Skills Commission and seeing that Future demand for my position was strong assures me the decision, I made is still a safe one. Also, despite the much higher current demand there is for other position I believe as Network Architect is a position that I will more excel at compared to other more in demand positions, this because my personal strength, skills and passion is more aligned with the position I choose.</p>
