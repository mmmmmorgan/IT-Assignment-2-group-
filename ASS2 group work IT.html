<h2>Technologies – Surgical Robots</h2>
<p>Over the past century, robots have taken leaps and bound in revolutionising the way that people live their life in all sorts of ways. Often, the first thing that springs to mind when one pictures a robot is the classic image of a brutish robotic arm in a car factory, spinning and sending sparks flying at an alarming pace. But the talents of robots are myriad and diverse. A world away from the production line, the welding-arm has a distant relative: Robotic Surgery Devices. These complicated and precise machines perform intricate surgeries on human patients who are in dire need of medical care. </p>
<p>For twenty years, the most advanced surgical robots in active use across the world has been the da Vinci Surgical System, manufactured and designed by the American company Intuitive Surgical. Physically, the da Vinci Surgical System is a number of robotic arms which connect to a device positioned next to the operating table with a patient. The arms can be fitted with all manner of tools needed for surgery, as well as a postionable camera which provides useful footage. The arms are controlled by a surgeon who is usually positioned right next to the patient and the robot. Ever since its invention at the turn of the century, the da Vinci Surgical System has become widely accepted into medical practice. There are an estimated 6000 of them in operation worldwide.</p>
<p>Surgical robots can perform a variety of different sorts of surgeries, but the current models do have some flaws. The da Vinci Surgical System, which is mainly used for Hysterectomies (partial or complete removal of the womb) and Prostatectomies (partial or removal of the prostate). As technology progresses, it is inevitable that a robot will be built which can perform more complicated surgeries in other parts of the body. The da Vinci Surgical System also has a high price tag – nearly 2 million dollars. Because the device is so expensive, it means that it has a limited market penetration. For a system to become truly widespread, it should be cheap enough for any surgery to afford one. </p>
<p>The da Vinci Surgical System has revolutionised robotic surgeries, but progress is in the process of marching on. When it was designed in 1999, Intuitive Surgical took out a 20-year patent on its design. Now, twenty years on, other companies are vying for market space with new designs. One such design is the Intelligent Surgical Unit (ISU), from the American company Asensus Surgical. The ISU differs from its competitors because not all its functions are controlled carefully by human hand. It features a camera which can be controlled by an automatic computer program. The company is investigating machine learning, which it will use to control various aspects of its future designs. Another company making strides in surgical robot designs is Johnson and Johnson, with their device called Ottava. This year, the Ottava is undergoing clinical trials before it can make its way into operating theatres. Unlike other robots, the six arms of Ottava is attached to the operating table, in such a way that it creates no clutter for patients or surgeons. With medical giants like Johnson and Johnson muscling their way into the surgical robotics space, its clear that these devices are here to stay. </p>
<p>The advances that contribute most to the development of new surgical robots are those in the field of machine learning. With advances in machine learning, surgical robots would be able to perform parts of, or even whole simple, operations without the need for human handling.  This would revolutionise the practice of surgery entirely and change the way medical care is administered.  </p>
<p>The impact of having less involvement from a surgeon is obvious – it would mean cheaper and more effective surgeries would become available to more people more easily. One of the most notable changes would be the steep reduction in operating costs of surgeries. In parts of the world where finding properly trained professionals are scarce, it would mean lifesaving medical treatment could be shipped inside a box – no training needed. </p>
<p>Of course, fully automated surgeries are still a way off. What is most likely to change is more and more surgeons will adopt robotic assistance. This means that surgery will involve less assistants, which will result in a reduction of price. It will also reduce the margin of error, as properly programmed medical robots aren’t subject to the inconsistencies which plague human decision-making. </p>
<p>There are two groups of people who will be most affected by the advancement of surgical robotics technology. First and foremost, the surgeons. They will have to learn new systems and adapt to new tools. Patients, on the other hand, will hopefully be able to access their surgeries at a lower price point. There will no doubt be some resistance to the new technology, but as it proves its efficacy patients will surely accept it.</p>
<p>Surgical robotics follows the larger societal trend of the modern developed world, in that it is a form of automation. Automated industries necessarily involve less human involvement. It makes surgical assistants redundant, and in the future perhaps even the surgeons themselves. Already existing models replace several tools currently used in surgery. </p>
<p>I have never had surgery, and I am not planning to have one any time in the future. That said, if reliable surgical robotics became more prevalent, I could rest easy knowing that I could access cheaper and less fallible care – should I need it. I’m sure as my friends and I get older, all of us will need surgery of some sort. I can imagine a future where these devices are installed into homes for private citizens to use under the care of automated programs.</p>
