<h1>Gallery Exhibitor</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>‘Gallery Exhibitor’ is a website that enables the virtualisation of an exhibition on a computer web browser. It allows the user to input a series of artworks to generate a 3D navigable world, which is modelled off a gallery. Exhibitors can share links to their galleries online via a link and leave a space for people to comment on their exhibit full of artworks.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>With how livable the internet can be, and its mass convenience, it poses an opportunity for a highly spreadable and easy delivery of artworks. Galleries, in their current form, have many problems that IT can offer solutions to. Simply put, galleries are hard to access. If an exhibition is in a particular gallery, prospective visitors must be in the same city as it to see the artworks. Touring exhibitions have attempted to solve this problem, but they cannot match the global delivery of an internet website. Online, artists attempt to recreate the cohesive delivery of an exhibition achieved by a traditional in-person gallery, usually with the dominant visual platforms such as social media. But social media is a poor recreation of a true gallery – it lacks a sense of environment, and it is also missing the curated and truly customisable experience. The solution is ‘Gallery Exhibitor’, a user-based customisable artwork showcasing tool that can collectively and cohesively present an exhibition online, just as a traditional gallery can present one in person. It also has potential to change the way we encounter the artworks, as the online gallery space is further explored and developed. The potential of it being highly transmissible via the internet and very accessible - from home, train, etc. makes it very convenient for the audience to engage.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The website allows a user to upload a set of images or videos to the software, edit their sizes then be able to generate a plain white walled 3D space that contains the media. This generated world gets a link that is sharable, allowing people to tune in and explore the exhibit. Once someone has received the link, they can then navigate the 3D space and view the artworks in a style not dissimilar to a video game. Exhibitions generated by the software are timed and only available for a set amount of time (e.g., One week), but users can ‘visit the gallery’ as many times as they want during the timeframe. The gallery also features an anonymous chat log on the sidebar, which allows users to comment. The chat log messages are additive and are kept up for the duration of the exhibition.</p>
<p>The website opens and presents a menu which the user can use to generate their works. First, they can upload picture files and video files. Then they are given the opportunity to modify the finer details of their exhibition. They will be able to adjust global lighting, artwork focused lighting or to add spatial sound. Once the ‘world’ is designed and created, Gallery Exhibitor generates a link, which can be shared over social media or simply copy-pasted. When a ‘player’ receives and follows a link, they arrive in the 3D gallery space. They can then navigate the world in a conventional way – keyboard (either WASD or arrow keys) and mouse. By exploring the gallery, they can spend as much time as they like with each work. Hovering the cursor over a particular work presents a digital representation of a museum label (with the name, year, medium, and description of the work). While browsing the gallery, they can access the comment page, and read the thoughts of other visitors to the same gallery.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<h4>Game Engine and Coding Languages</h4>
<p>The website is to be web game engine based. Our plan for web application involves using the WebGL game engine and creative tool PlayCanvas. PlayCanvas is a visual development platform for interactive web content and will serve as both the creative tool to create the web application and 3D environment itself, as well as the hosting capabilities of PlayCanvas. It is important to note that PlayCanvas is founded on HTML technologies and coded with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Currently, HTML5 is currently being used by 90% of all websites on the Internet. This number is unquestionable proof of the reliability and security of HTML5. However, as with all websites, the cybersecurity capabilities of HTML must be considered and implemented in order to provide a safe user experience for all our users. With our web application, we plan on using communication technologies and web messaging APIs, and thus it is incredibly important that our cybersecurity standards are quality-ensured to prevent cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Such attacks could include Cross Site Scripting (XSS), a type of injection attack in which malicious scripts are injected into a browser-side script, potentially being sent to all users using the web application. As such, proper HTML standards such as validation and authentication of origins (e.g., a user’s computer to the web server), or ensuring messages are communicated as ‘data’ and not ‘code’, preventing such vulnerabilities from occurring.</p>
<p>Our web application, Gallery Exhibitor, will also ensure that the images that are specifically uploaded by creators are not of malicious nature, both in content and in data, aggressively scrutinizing the images to create a safe virtual experience. Malicious creators may choose to attack File Upload vulnerabilities, which we will prevent through authorization and integrity checking through user permission management, as well as File Sanitization to ensure that malicious creators cannot upload images and data with malicious extensions, such as .php, allowing creators to execute code via the web server.</p>
<p>In terms of the content uploaded, we will also utilize JavaScript technologies, specifically the getUserMedia API combined with js-objectdetect JavaScript library. Utilizing these two libraries gives our web application the ability to ‘see’ the content within images, and with real-time object detection, allows the web engine to detect unwanted, malicious content. Nudity content can also be ignored if chosen, as technologies such as DeepAI uses JavaScript to create a Nudity Detection API.</p>
<h4>Website Creation and Hosting</h4>
<p>As our website is built upon HTML5 and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS, this technology allows our website and web application to be accessible with any browser, as most modern-day browsers support these technologies. This greatly increases our reachability and accessibility for our target market, allowing users to easily interact with our web application.</p>
<p>The website, as previously mentioned, will present users with a menu and options in which Gallery Exhibitor can perform its necessary functions. Upon executing the creation of the virtual exhibition, the WebGL game engine, PlayCanvas, is called from the PlayCanvas domain. This means that our website will act as the intermediary between the hosting domain (PlayCanvas) and the end user, allowing real-time interaction and seamless connectivity.</p>
<p>To embed Gallery Exhibitor into our website, PlayCanvas offers two options for self-hosting a PlayCanvas application on a user-created domain. The options include; embedding a PlayCanvas hosted game using an iframe, or downloading the game and uploading the files to our site. Our group has opted with option 1, as it uses the hosting power of PlayCanvas, HTML technologies, and our application’s assigned URL to easily embed the application as an iframe with the src property.</p>
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>Basic usability of a WebGL Game Engine is required. A command of desktop usage and general basic computer skills is necessary. The project should be feasible given the quality of existing WebGL Game Engines, which provide GUIs for ease of use, limiting the need for advanced coding. HTML and CSS knowledge is also required to set up and finalize the presentation of the website, including the digital interface of each part of website. If possible, JavaScript can also be used to add interactive elements, animations...The clarity and simplicity of the idea should make its progress straightforward with hurdles along the way ready to be tackled.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>Upon successful implementation, artists would have an open tool platform to process their art works in such a way as to display them with coherence and unity – giving their creations the presentation and order logic the artist intended in accordance with the tradition of the physical art gallery – a blank open and even space. The convenience of internet-based delivery means they can make their exhibit highly accessible and transmissible, allowing people all over the world and wherever they are to view. The engagement via the web also alters the way in which the artworks are interpreted and makes a critique of the internet's presence in the very traditional and possibly archaic art world. Gallery Exhibitor indicates an expanded and future take on the way exhibitions are engaged with.</p>
